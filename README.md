# DS Web App Project

This repository is for the web app prototype, which I will gradually
build while studying for _IBM Full-Stack JavaScript Developer
Professional Certificate from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)_.

## Requirements

### Tech Stacks

-   At the beginning, this project will be developed **only** with the
    technologies covered in the certificate course:

    -   HTML
    -   CSS
    -   JavaScript
    -   [ReactJS](https://react.dev/)
    -   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
    -   [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
    -   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

-   Later, however, some of them may be replaced by the following
    alternatives:

    -   [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
    -   [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) or
        [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Structure

-   The basic structure will be similar to that of a typical blogging
    platform.

-   The final product will be like a simple CMS.

### User Management

-   There will be multiple users.

-   Users will be added from the backend.

-   All the user information will be stored in the database.

### Writing & Reading

-   All the posts will be stored in the database under each username.

-   A post will be dynamically fetched from the database to be
    displayed on a web page.

-   Writing a post will be done from the frontend.

-   Writing a post will require username and password to access the
    database.

-   Reading a post will not require authentication.

### Images

-   When writing a post, images may be inserted.

-   All the images will be stored in separate directories named after
    each username & post. (Ex: `/images/username/postname/01.jpg`)

-   When a post is fetched from the database, the corresponding images
    will also be fetched from the directory.

## Notes

-   This is just the initial concept and will be modified as I
    continue studying.

-   It will be a fairly long journey!
